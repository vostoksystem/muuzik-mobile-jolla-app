# Muuzik! for Jolla / Sailfish OS

Muuzik was a music player application for the mobile OS SailfishOs fro Jolla.

Fully integrated with Sailfish UI, focussing on providing an user friendly interface, his main feature is to display song as directory instead off endless tags list and to merge content of both internal and sdcard into a simple list, making browsing for your music intuitive; what you added is what you see.

- Artwork for album, with automatic download
- Access full biography of your artist
- Get lyrics for your songs in a swipe
- Local cache; image, biography, lyrics, always available even with no network
- Configurable networking options, no surprise on your provider bill
- Playlist management
- Like an album ? bookmark it for quick access
- Random album; don't know what to listen, just ask !
- Timer; let's listen music for a limited time, with sound reducing control
- Player's controls available on the notification panel
- MPRIS protocol ready-
- and many more....

# Why "was" ?

After several year, the team at Jolla decided to infonce strick rules on apps, mandatories rules, also on legacy applications.

To work Muuzik! require : 

- additional/external package : **forbiden**
- write access to shared directories : **forbiden**
- write access to media directory : **forbiden**
- direct access to media : **forbiden**
- call system app : **forbiden**
- read system setting : **forbiden**
etc...

Basically all key features of this app are now impossible (for regular users), therefore, I stopped any developement and event move await - as many - from the Jolla mobile device.

# Legacy

Note this app is **unmaintened** I won't be able to help you.

This is the last full code - even additionnal lib - of the app. I cannot garaty it will even build on the la QTCreator version but this is a good exemple for how to structure a Cpp / QT app, mobile or desktop.
